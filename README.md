**Abstract** Process understanding and modeling is at the core of scientific reasoning. Principled _parametric_ and mechanistic modeling dominated science and engineering until the recent emergence of machine learning. Despite great success in many areas, machine learning algorithms in the Earth and climate sciences, and more broadly in physical sciences, are not explicitly designed to be physically-consistent and may, therefore, violate the most basic laws of physics. In this work, motivated by the field of algorithmic fairness, we reconcile data-driven machine learning with physics modeling by introducing a _nonparametric_ and _nonlinear_ physics-aware regression method. By incorporating a dependence-based regularizer, the method leads to models that are consistent with domain knowledge, as reflected by either simulations from physical models or ancillary data. The idea can conversely encourage independence of model predictions with other variables. The method is computationally efficient and comes with a closed-form analytic solution. Through a consistency-vs-accuracy path diagram, one can assess the consistency between data and physical models. We demonstrate through examples on simulations and real experiments in Earth and climate studies that, by incorporating a priori domain knowledge into the machine learning framework, it is possible to improve both the accuracy and the physical (domain-based) consistency of the machine learning model.
